# WEBD-2008: Web Development 2 Final Project
## By Hanz Samonte

## Description
Assigned to develop a Content Management System (CMS), I built a website using my Web Development skills that I've acquired from learning through Visual Studio Code and studying HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP.
The goal of this project is to create a PHP CRUD-based CMS for a fictional client under a Winnipeg-based business. Originally, I went through with the idea of an ecommerce platform for users to interact with
the contents provided in the website. Now, this became an ecommerce-turned archive/catalog for Clothes, called Vintage Archives. This is by far the biggest project that I've done, I may have missed some
aspects of the website (errors or extra implementations for example) but I plan to refine it as I work through my journey into coding!
